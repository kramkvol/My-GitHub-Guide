## GitHub Guide
### College (2017–2021)
Programming-related subjects didn’t appear until the winter semester of my second year (2018).  

I found a video course on C++ and started watching everything I could while typing code alongside.  
When I moved to the Czech Republic, I took my old notebook with me — it’s full of handwritten C++ theory notes from that time :) 

In the 3rd and 4th years, we studied **C#** and **MS SQL Server**, along with many graphics-related subjects — that was my chosen specialization.  
There were A LOT of assignments using **WinForms**, but I decided to upload only my thesis to GitHub.  
That was the moment I realized **I actually enjoyed programming and working with databases** — and that **I really didn’t want to work with graphics anymore**.

### Czech Technical University in Prague – Bachelor's Degree (2023– )
#### 1st Year
**Winter semester, 2023**
- [🔗B0B36ZAL – Introduction to Programming (Python)](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B36ZAL-Introduction-to-Programming) <br>
  A beginner-level course covering Python basics.
- [🔗B6B39ZMT – Foundations of Multimedia Production](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZMT-Foundations-of-Multimedia-Production)  
  I swore I’d never deal with graphics again...  
  But then, in my first year, I had to take this course.  
  As a final project, we had to direct and edit a video.
  
**Summer semester, 2024**
- [🔗B0B36PJV – Programming in Java](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B36PJV-Programming-in-Java) <br>
  Unfortunately, at the time of implementing the final project, I wasn't yet familiar with design patterns, so the code quality is a bit messy. But it works :)
- [🔗B6B36TS1 – Software Testing](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36TS1-Software-Testing) <br>
  The final project required writing process-based and mock tests. 
  I implemented them for my final Java project. All the links and explanations are in this repository :)
- B0B36DBS – Database Systems ❌ *Repository not yet created* <br>
  After this course, I made a rule to never choose topics that are *too* ambitious again. 
  I really enjoy the process of designing database systems and working with data, but this particular project turned out to be a complete failure :(
- [🔗B6B36SMP – Analysis and Modeling of Software Requirements](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36SMP-Analysis-and-Modeling-of-Software-Requirements) <br>
  Team project. This course wasn't about coding, but focused on design and analysis. 
  I found it useful — it reminded me of something similar I had back in college.

#### 2nd Year
**Winter semester, 2024**
- [🔗B6B39ZWA – Foundations of Web Applications](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZWA-Foundations-of-Web-Applications) <br>
  When I wrote this CV (in my 2nd year), this was the hardest but also the most interesting course for me.  
  During the semester, I learned **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **PHP**.  
  In the final project, I used a **MySQL** database to store data.
- [🔗B6B36OMO – Object-Oriented Design and Modeling](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36OMO-Object-oriented-design-and-Modeling) <br>
  A team final project in **Java**. I found this course very interesting and important, so in my pet projects I try to focus on using design patterns.
 
**Summer semester, 2025**
- [🔗B0B39KAJ – Client Applications in JavaScript](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B39KAJ-Client-applications-in-JavaScript) <br>
  A more relaxed course after the intense B6B39ZWA :D
- [🔗B6B39ZAN – Basic Android Development](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZAN-Basic-Android-development) <br>
  Android app written in **Kotlin**. Since I love reading, the idea came to me quickly. 
  I might add data export to a text file in the future, so nothing gets lost if the app is uninstalled. 
  If I do that, I might actually use the app myself :) 
- [🔗B6B16ZDA – Basics of Data Analysis](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B16ZDA-Basics-of-Data-Analysis) <br>
  I realized that data analysis is not for me :)
