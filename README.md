### 1st Year
**Winter semester, 2023**
- [🔗B0B36ZAL – Introduction to Programming (Python)](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B36ZAL-Introduction-to-Programming)
- [🔗B6B39ZMT – Foundations of Multimedia Production](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZMT-Foundations-of-Multimedia-Production)  

**Summer semester, 2024**
- [🔗B0B36PJV – Programming in Java](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B36PJV-Programming-in-Java)
  Unfortunately, at the time of implementing the final project, I wasn't yet familiar with design patterns, so the code quality is a bit messy. But it works :)
- [🔗B6B36TS1 – Software Testing](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36TS1-Software-Testing)
  The final project required writing process-based and mock tests.
  I implemented them for my final Java project. All the links and explanations are in this repository :)
  - [🔗B0B36DBS – Database Systems]() ❌
  After this course, I made a rule to never choose topics that are *too* ambitious again.  
  I really enjoy the process of designing database systems and working with data, but this particular project turned out to be a complete failure :(
- [🔗B6B36SMP – Analysis and Modeling of Software Requirements](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36SMP-Analysis-and-Modeling-of-Software-Requirements)
  Team project. This course wasn't about coding, but focused on design and analysis.
  I found it useful — it reminded me of something similar I had back in college.

### 2nd Year
**Winter semester, 2024**
- [🔗B6B39ZWA – Foundations of Web Applications](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZWA-Foundations-of-Web-Applications)
  When I wrote this CV (in my 2nd year), this was the hardest but also the most interesting course for me.  
  During the semester, I learned HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP.  
  In the final project, I used a MySQL database to store data.
- [🔗B6B36OMO – Object-Oriented Design and Modeling](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36OMO-Object-oriented-design-and-Modeling)
  A team final project in Java. I found this course very interesting and important, so in my pet projects I try to focus on using design patterns.
 
**Summer semester, 2025**
- [🔗B0B39KAJ – Client Applications in JavaScript](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B39KAJ-Client-applications-in-JavaScript)
  A more relaxed course after the intense B6B39ZWA :D
- [🔗B6B39ZAN – Basic Android Development](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZAN-Basic-Android-development)
  Android app written in Kotlin. Since I love reading, the idea came to me quickly.  
  I might add data export to a text file in the future, so nothing gets lost if the app is uninstalled.  
  If I do that, I might actually use the app myself :)
- [🔗B6B16ZDA – Basics of Data Analysis](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B16ZDA-Basics-of-Data-Analysis)  
  I realized that data analysis is not for me :)
