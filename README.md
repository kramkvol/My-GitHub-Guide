## GitHub Guide
### College (2017–2021)
Programming-related subjects started in the winter semester of my second year (2018).

At that time, I followed a C++ video course and practiced by writing a lot of code. I still keep a notebook full of handwritten C++ theory notes from that period, which I took with me when I moved to the Czech Republic :)

In the 3rd and 4th years, we studied C# and MS SQL Server, together with many graphics-related subjects. Most assignments were based on WinForms. On GitHub, I uploaded my thesis project in C#.

This was also the time when I discovered that I truly enjoy programming and working with databases, and decided to focus more on software development rather than graphics.

### Czech Technical University in Prague – Bachelor's Degree (2023– )
#### 1st Year
**Winter semester, 2023**
- [🔗B0B36ZAL – Introduction to Programming (Python)](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B36ZAL-Introduction-to-Programming) <br>
  A beginner-level course covering Python basics.
- [🔗B6B39ZMT – Foundations of Multimedia Production](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZMT-Foundations-of-Multimedia-Production) ❌ *Private repository* <br>
Although graphics is not my main focus, this course introduced me to multimedia production and gave me experience in video editing as part of the final project.
  
**Summer semester, 2024**
- [🔗B0B36PJV – Programming in Java](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B36PJV-Programming-in-Java) <br>
  At the time of implementing the final project, I was not yet familiar with design patterns, so the code could be structured better. However, the project is fully functional and demonstrated my ability to deliver working software.
- [🔗B6B36TS1 – Software Testing](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36TS1-Software-Testing) <br>
  The final project required writing process-based and mock tests. 
  I implemented them for my final Java project. All the links and explanations are in this repository.
- B0B36DBS – Database Systems ❌ *Repository not yet created* <br>
  This project was quite ambitious and I faced several challenges, which limited the final result. Still, the course gave me valuable experience in database design, and I realized how much I enjoy working with data.
- [🔗B6B36SMP – Analysis and Modeling of Software Requirements](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36SMP-Analysis-and-Modeling-of-Software-Requirements) <br>
  Team project. This course wasn't about coding, but focused on design and analysis. 
  I found it useful — it reminded me of something similar I had back in college.
---
#### 2nd Year
**Winter semester, 2024**
- [🔗B6B39ZWA – Foundations of Web Applications](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZWA-Foundations-of-Web-Applications) <br>
  When I wrote this CV (in my 2nd year), this was the hardest but also the most interesting course for me.  
  During the semester, I learned **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **PHP**.  
  In the final project, I used a **MySQL** database to store data.
- [🔗B6B36OMO – Object-Oriented Design and Modeling](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B36OMO-Object-oriented-design-and-Modeling) <br>
  A team final project in **Java**. I found this course very interesting and important, so in my pet projects I try to focus on using design patterns.
 
**Summer semester, 2025**
- [🔗B0B39KAJ – Client Applications in JavaScript](https://github.com/kramkvol/B0B39KAJ-Client-applications-in-JavaScript) <br>
  A more relaxed course after the intense B6B39ZWA :D
- [🔗B6B39ZAN – Basic Android Development](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B39ZAN-Basic-Android-development) <br>
  Android app written in **Kotlin**. Since I love reading, the idea came to me quickly. 
  I might add data export to a text file in the future, so nothing gets lost if the app is uninstalled. 
  If I do that, I might actually use the app myself :) 
- [🔗B6B16ZDA – Basics of Data Analysis](https://github.com/kramkvol/B6B16ZDA-Basics-of-Data-Analysis) <br>
  I realized that data analysis is not for me :)
